          In the past few years, the number of different health insurance programs has increased at an amazing
          rate. Even within one company, there may be several programs with varying benefits and requirements.
          There is no way that we can possibly know, or keep up-to-date with, each program's provisions.

          Please understand that if we have not been advised in advance of your program's requirements or

          In addition, there are times that we may not be able to obtain a consultant or laboratory that is
          participating with your program. It will be up to you to work this out with your insurance company.
